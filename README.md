# Detroit-Crime-Data
This data reflects reported criminal offenses that have occurred in the City of Detroit from 2017-2019. Criminal offense data was extracted from the Detroit Police Department's (DPD) records management system. This data set contains the most recent data available and is updated anytime DPD sends official crime records contributing to the Michigan Incident Crime Reporting (MICR) or the National Incident Based Reporting systems (reflected by the IBR Date field). It should be noted that some incidents involve the commission of multiple offenses, such as a domestic assault where property was also vandalized. Accordingly, the data describe all offenses associated with all reported incidents
